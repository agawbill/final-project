Rails App, utilizing the TMDb API, AJAX, JavaScript interactive interface.

Regular users can create lists and search the DB (the core functionality of this app)...

USER GUEST ID: guest@testing.com

USER GUEST PW: 123456

This was my final project for my 3 month, full time intensive bootcamp at NYCDA. It's done in RAILS and JavaScript. 

I wanted to create something that encompassed most of the skills we covered during the program.

Essentially, there are 2 user groups â€” admins and regular users. Admins can create and post blogs, while regular users can comment on blogs, and also dynamically search for movies using the "Make List" option, where they can create movie lists (navigating TMDb API) and save them to a database. 

I created most of the filters on the backend (sorting by genre, movie ratings, etc.). 

The API has a neat "Discover" feature, too, that's built in, where if you have the ID#s for an actor(s) and director(s), you can search and see all the movies they've worked on together. 

I created an interface that would allow the user to search for actors and directors (also include a year in the query), to include in a search to utilize the Discover feature. 

You can like and also share movie lists. 

There's a video beneath the screenshots where I walk you through/navigate the project if you're interested in learning more on my portfolio page (www.anthonygawbill.com).

It includes the following:

Use of APIs.
AJAX requests.
An interactive UI to search for movies (utilizing vanilla JavaScript).
Backend using Ruby on RAILS to save movie lists, and sort movie queries (data is pooled into an array before being served to the front-end).
Also your standard blog app... blogs can be posted by Admin user class, comments can be left by User user class (I built from scratch).
